## üöÄ Features

1. **AI-Driven Liquidity Allocation**

   - Uses machine learning to analyze on-chain and off-chain data for optimal liquidity allocation.
   - Dynamically manages staking, lending, and liquidity provisioning across protocols and RWAs.

2. **RWA Tokenization**

   - Tokenize real-world assets like real estate, invoices, or commodities using ERC-1155 tokens.
   - Store metadata securely on IPFS and integrate seamlessly into DeFi ecosystems.

3. **AI-Powered Metadata Validation**

   - Validate user-provided metadata using advanced LLMs like LLaMA.
   - Leverage Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to ensure data validity without revealing sensitive information.

4. **Decentralized Perpetual Markets**

   - Integrated perpetual trading system with Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) infrastructure.
   - AI models assess and mitigate liquidation risks in real time.

5. **Intent-Based Liquidity Optimization**

   - Enables users to specify financial goals (e.g., maximize staking, minimize risk).
   - AI dynamically matches user intents with optimal strategies in Mantle's ecosystem.

6. **Developer Toolkit**
   - APIs and SDKs for building AI-enhanced DeFi applications.
   - Tools for simulating and optimizing liquidity strategies.

## üìñ User Flow for Liquidity Pool Interaction

1. **Wallet Connection**

   - User connects their wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the ALIQ platform.
   - Wallet connection is securely established using Web3.js.

2. **Asset Deposit**

   - Users deposit crypto assets or tokenized RWAs into the liquidity pool.
   - Deposits are secured by smart contracts deployed on Mantle.

3. **Metadata Submission**

   - Users submit metadata (e.g., property name, address, and price) for RWAs.
   - Metadata is stored on IPFS and validated via AI models.

4. **Metadata Validation**

   - The AI validates the metadata for accuracy and appropriateness.
   - ZKPs are generated to ensure metadata integrity without revealing the original data.

5. **Liquidity Allocation**

   - The platform‚Äôs AI dynamically allocates liquidity based on the user‚Äôs intent (e.g., maximize staking returns, minimize risk).
   - Allocations are optimized across DeFi protocols and tokenized RWAs.

6. **Earnings**
   - Users earn rewards from staking, lending, or yield farming.
   - AI rebalances liquidity periodically to maximize returns.
